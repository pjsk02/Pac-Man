# Pac-Man
# ðŸ‘¾ Pac-Man AI Game (Unity)

A fully functional **Pac-Man clone** built using the **Unity Real-Time Game Engine**, featuring intelligent ghost behavior driven by **AI pathfinding**.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- ðŸŸ¡ Classic Pac-Man gameplay  
- ðŸ‘» AI-driven ghosts using FSM (Finite State Machines)  
- ðŸ§  Ghosts exhibit chase, scatter, and frightened behaviors  
- ðŸ’¥ Power pellets toggle ghost behavior dynamically  
- ðŸ§­ Pathfinding via Unity's NavMesh or custom A* logic  
- ðŸŽ¯ Score tracking, win/lose conditions, and high score system

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open project in **Unity Hub** (tested on Unity 2022+)  
2. Click `Play` in the Unity Editor  
3. Navigate Pac-Man with arrow keys â€” avoid the ghosts!  
4. Eat all the pellets to win â€” or get caught to lose
